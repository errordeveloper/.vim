sunaku's Vim configuration
==========================

At long last, I have completely switched from jEdit to Vim [1],
and this [2] is the Vim configuration that made it all possible.

Prerequisites:

  Vim 7.2 or newer

Installation:

  # backup
  mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.bak
  mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.bak

  # install
  git clone git://github.com/sunaku/.vim.git ~/.vim
  ln -s ~/.vim/config.vim ~/.vimrc

  # bundles
  cd ~/.vim
  sh bundle.sh

Bundle management:

  Bundles (also known as "Vim scripts") are installed
  into their own, self-contained subdirectories inside
  the bundle/ directory.  They are dynamically added
  to Vim's runtimepath (at the top of config.vim) so
  that Vim knows about them and loads them normally.

  Installing and upgrading bundles:

    cd ~/.vim
    sh bundle.sh

  Adding bundles from any Git repository:

    #
    # XXX is the URL of the bundle Git repository
    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    git submodule add XXX bundle/YYY
    git commit -m "install YYY bundle" bundle/YYY

  Adding bundles from vim-scripts.org on GitHub:

    #
    # XXX is the name of the Vim script repository
    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    git submodule add git://github.com/vim-scripts/XXX.git bundle/YYY
    git commit -m "install YYY bundle" bundle/YYY

  Removing bundles:

    #
    # YYY is the name (your choice) of the bundle
    #
    git rm --cached bundle/YYY
    git commit -m "remove YYY bundle" bundle/YYY
    git clean -fd bundle/YYY
